    <p>
      <strong>SLUDGE</strong> is a curated database of high- and medium-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) 
      recovered from anaerobic digesters and related bioreactor systems. It is a resource for studying the microbial 
      communities that drive biogas and volatile fatty acid production, helping us understand and optimize waste 
      treatment and resource recovery processes.

<h2>Key Capabilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comparative genomics across digester ecosystems</li>
  <li>Metabolic pathway reconstruction for key microbial lineages</li>
  <li>Community function modeling to inform process optimization and engineering design</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔍 Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>High-quality, dereplicated MAGs with consistent taxonomy</li>
  <li>Standardized annotations using CheckM2, GTDB-Tk, DRAM, and more</li>
  <li>Metadata describing reactor type, operating conditions, and sample origin</li>
  <li>Tools and scripts for reproducible processing and analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧬 Why SLUDGE?</h2>
<p>
  Anaerobic digesters are complex, microbially-driven ecosystems central to sustainable waste management and bioenergy. 
  The diversity and function of many microbial lineages remain poorly understood. SLUDGE bridges this gap by linking 
  genome-level data to system performance, accelerating both basic and applied research in environmental biotechnology.
</p>

<h2>🛠️ Project Status</h2>
<p>
  SLUDGE is currently under active development. The first public release will include curated MAGs from full-scale 
  and lab-scale digesters, along with associated metadata and quality metrics.
</p>

<h2>📄 Citation</h2>
<p>
  A formal data paper and preprint will accompany the first release — stay tuned!
