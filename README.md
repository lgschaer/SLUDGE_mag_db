<h1 align="center">SLUDGE: Sequenced Lineages to Understand Digester Genomes for Engineering</h1>

<h2>🧬 Why SLUDGE?</h2>
<p>
  Anaerobic digesters are complex, microbially-driven ecosystems central to sustainable waste management and bioenergy. 
  The functional potential of many microbial lineages remain poorly understood. SLUDGE bridges this gap by providing a resource of metagenome assembled genomes for both basic and applied research in environmental biotechnology.
</p>

<h2>🛠️ Project Status</h2>
<p>
  SLUDGE is currently under active development. The first public release will include curated MAGs from full-scale 
  and lab-scale digesters, along with associated metadata and quality metrics.
