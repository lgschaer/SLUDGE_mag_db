  <b>SLUDGE</b> (Sequenced Lineages for Understanding Digester Genomes for Engineering) is a curated database of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from anaerobic digesters and bioreactor systems. It provides a framework for understanding microbial lineages that drive waste treatment and bioenergy production.

# SLUDGE: Sequenced Lineages for Understanding Digester Genomes for Engineering

## SLUDGE is a curated database of high and medium quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from anaerobic digesters and related bioreactor systems. SLUDGE is a resouce for studying the microbial communities underlying biogas and volatile fatty acid production for understanding microbial communities underlying waste treatment and resource recovery.

By integrating MAGs from diverse sources and standardizing their annotation, SLUDGE enables:

Comparative genomics across digester ecosystems

Metabolic pathway reconstruction for key microbial lineages

Community function modeling to inform process optimization and engineering design

🔍 Features

High-quality, dereplicated MAGs with consistent taxonomy

Standardized annotations (CheckM2, GTDB-Tk, DRAM, etc.)

Metadata describing reactor type, operating conditions, and sample origin

Tools and scripts for reproducible processing and analysis

🧬 Why SLUDGE?

Anaerobic digesters are complex, microbially-driven ecosystems central to sustainable waste management and bioenergy. Yet, the diversity and function of many lineages remain poorly understood. SLUDGE provides a foundation for linking genome-level data to system performance, accelerating both basic and applied research in environmental biotechnology.

🛠️ Project Status

SLUDGE is currently under active development. The first public release will include curated MAGs from full-scale and lab-scale digesters, along with associated metadata and quality metrics.

📄 Citation

A formal data paper and preprint will accompany the first release — stay tuned!
